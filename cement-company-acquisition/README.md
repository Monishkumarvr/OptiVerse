### Problem Statement:
Adani Cements is evaluating the acquisition of a medium-scale cement company worth 10,000 Cr. There are multiple potential candidates with similar scale and market share. The goal is to identify the optimal acquisition target based on various strategic criteria including market share, revenue growth, production capacity, cost structure, compliance rating, market regions served, number of plants, and number of integrated plants.

### Constraints:
1. **Budget Constraint**: The acquisition cost for the target company should be within 10,000 Cr.
2. **Single Acquisition**: Only one company should be selected for acquisition.
3. **Cost Range**: The acquisition cost is considered within a negotiable range of ±10% of the offered price.

### Objective:
Maximize the overall benefit from the acquisition by evaluating the following weighted criteria:
- **Market Share**: Contribution to Adani’s market presence.
- **Revenue Growth**: Potential for future revenue growth.
- **Production Capacity**: Increase in total production capacity.
- **Cost Structure**: Efficiency of the cost structure, with preference for lower costs.
- **Compliance Rating**: Adherence to regulatory standards.
- **Market Regions**: Diversification and expansion into new market regions.
- **Number of Plants**: Increase in the number of operational plants.
- **Integrated Plants**: Number of plants with integrated production capabilities.

The overall score for each candidate is calculated based on these criteria, and the candidate with the highest score within the budget and cost constraints is selected for acquisition.
